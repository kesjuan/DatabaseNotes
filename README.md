# DatabaseNotes

A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. 
SQL is a programming language used by nearly all relational databases to query, manipulate, and define data, and to provide access control

relational database are organized as a set of tables with columns and rows. Relational database technology provides the most efficient and flexible way to access structured information.

object-oriented databases are represented in the form of objects, as in object-oriented programming.

a distributed database consists of two or more files located in different sites. The database may be stored on multiple computers, located in the same physical location, or scattered over different networks.

A central repository for data, a data warehouse is a type of database specifically designed for fast query and analysis.
NoSQL, or nonrelational database, allows unstructured and semistructured data to be stored and manipulated (in contrast to a relational database).
A graph database stores data in terms of entities and the relationships between entities
An OLTP database is a speedy, analytic database designed for large numbers of transactions performed by multiple users.
cloud database is a collection of data, either structured or unstructured, that resides on a private, public, or hybrid cloud computing platform. There are two types of cloud database models: traditional and database as a service (DBaaS). With DBaaS, administrative tasks and maintenance are performed by a service provider.

Multimodel databases combine different types of database models into a single, integrated back end. 

document databases are a modern way to store data in JSON format rather than rows and columns.
 self-driving databases (also known as autonomous databases) are cloud-based and use machine learning to automate database tuning, security, backups, updates, and other routine management tasks traditionally performed by database administrators.
 
 A database typically requires a comprehensive database software program known as a database management system (DBMS). A DBMS serves as an interface between the database and its end users or programs, allowing users to retrieve, update, and manage how the information is organized and optimized. 
 
 MySQL is an open source relational database management system based on SQL. It was designed and optimized for web applications and can run on any platform.
